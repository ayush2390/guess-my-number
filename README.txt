Guess my number game:

A random number will be generated by the game between 1-20, the user has to guess the number.

The maximum attempts the user will take the lower the score will get. Therefore, the user has to guess the number in the minimum amount of attempts.

If the guessed number will be high than the generated number, then it will show "Too high" and if the guessed number will be low than the generated number, then it will show "Too low".
